*The main area is the heart of our makerspace — a large, open shared workspace where members gather to work on projects, collaborate, and socialise. It serves as the central hub connecting all the specialised workshops.*

## What You'll Find
- **Large worktables** – for assembly, planning, and general project work
- **Shared hand tools** – for quick tasks that don't require a dedicated workshop
- **Whiteboards and planning space** – for sketching ideas and coordinating projects
- **Comfortable seating** – for breaks, discussions, and community events

## Usage
The main area is open to all members during regular hours. Please keep the shared tables clear after use and return any tools to their designated spots.
