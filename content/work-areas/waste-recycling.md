*Keeping our makerspace clean and sustainable is a shared responsibility. Our waste and recycling area is set up to make sorting easy and ensure materials are disposed of properly.*

## Waste Streams
- **General waste** – non-recyclable items
- **Paper and cardboard** – clean, dry paper and flattened boxes
- **Plastic and metal** – packaging, cans, and containers
- **Wood offcuts** – small pieces that can't be reused
- **Electronic waste** – old components and circuit boards

## Guidelines
- Sort your waste into the correct bins — labels are posted above each container
- Break down cardboard boxes before disposing
- Do not leave hazardous materials (chemicals, batteries, paint) in the general bins — ask a board member for proper disposal
- If a bin is full, notify a member of the team rather than overfilling it
