## How It Started

The O'Town Garage began in 2017, when a group of local technology enthusiasts realized that Odense lacked a public, accessible place where people could learn, experiment, and turn their ideas into physical reality. They envisioned a workshop open to everyone — a space where tools, knowledge, and community could come together.

## How It's Going

What began with a focus on advanced technology and robotics gradually transformed into a **community‑driven workshop** shaped by the diverse interests of its members. Today, the O'Town Garage is a warm, welcoming environment where people explore everything from electronics and woodworking to 3D printing, crafting, cosplay builds, repairs, and prototyping.

The makerspace offers the tools and space needed to support an entire creative process — from early sketches and prototypes to finished projects. Members work independently on their own ideas while benefiting from the informal knowledge‑sharing and collaboration that naturally occur in a shared workshop.

## Who We Are

Run entirely by volunteers through a nonprofit board, the O'Town Garage is home to a growing group of **around 30 active members**. Together, they maintain a space that remains open to the public, affordable, and grounded in the belief that learning and creating should be accessible to everyone.

Whether you're an experienced maker or someone simply curious to try something new, the O'Town Garage provides a place where you can learn, build, and become part of a supportive community of creators.
