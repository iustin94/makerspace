If you're new to the makerspace and want to understand how to become part of the community, here is the simple path to get started:

## 1. Get Familiar With the Makerspace

Browse our website to learn what the makerspace offers. Visit the [Work Areas](/work-areas/) section to see the different tools, physical work tables, and specialized areas available. This step helps you understand what you can work with and whether the space fits your needs.

## 2. Know the Rules (**Important**)

Before going any further, take the time to familiarize yourself with the makerspace rules and policies. Knowing what is expected of you as a member is essential. You can find everything in the [Documents](/docs/) section of the website, including:

- [Articles of Association](/docs/articles-of-association/) — the formal foundation of the organization
- [Terms of Membership](/docs/terms-of-membership/) — what is expected of members and what you agree to when joining
- [Cookies and Privacy Policy](/docs/cookies-and-privacy-policy/) — how we handle your data

Understanding these documents helps ensure a smooth experience for you and everyone in the community.

## 3. Join an Orientation Day

When you feel that the makerspace is something you'd like to be part of, the next step is to visit us in person. Attend one of our orientation days during an open‑house session. Here you can tour the physical space, ask questions, and get a real sense of the environment and community.

## 4. Become a Member

Once you've decided you want full access, sign up on our website as a paying member. After registering, join the [makerspace Discord](https://discord.gg/HDR8jsUp) and arrange an introduction meeting with one of the board members.

## 5. Your First Introduction

During your introduction, you will learn:

- How to access and close the space securely
- What responsibilities members have (lights, doors, tidiness, etc.)
- How to use the tools and work areas safely

Most tools require an introductory session with someone qualified to teach their proper and safe use. This ensures all members can work confidently and responsibly.
