## Our Story

### How It All Began

A small group of community members came together with a simple idea: that collective action could create meaningful change. What started as a few neighbors helping each other has grown into The Oto Town Garage, a vibrant community of volunteers dedicated to making a difference.

Our founders recognized that many people want to help their communities but don't always know where to start. They created a space where passion meets purpose, connecting willing volunteers with meaningful opportunities.

### Where We Are Today

Today, we have grown to include many active volunteers who contribute thousands of hours each year to various programs and initiatives.
