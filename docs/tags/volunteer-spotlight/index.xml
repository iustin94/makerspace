&lt;h3 id="her-journey"&gt;Her Journey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maria first joined as a student looking to gain experience, but quickly discovered a passion for community service that transformed her career path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Volunteering here has changed my life. I&amp;rsquo;ve gained skills, made friends, and found a sense of purpose I never expected.&amp;rdquo;
